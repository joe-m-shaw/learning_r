"Of the three main functional programming tools (functionals, function factories, and function operators), function factories are the least used. Generally, they donâ€™t tend to reduce overall code complexity but instead partition complexity into more easily digested chunks."

```{r}


power1 <- function(exp) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}

square <- power1(2)

cube <- power1(3)

square(3)

cube(3)

```

"The enclosing environment of the manufactured function is an execution environment of the function factory."

My translation: the external environment surrounding the produced function is the internal environment of the function that produces it.

"Whenever you create a function factory, make sure every argument is evaluated, using force() as necessary if the argument is only used by the manufactured function."
