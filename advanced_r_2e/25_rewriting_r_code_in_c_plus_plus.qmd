This chapter is about rewriting R code in C++ to make it quicker, which is probably beyond my current needs, so I've only made brief notes.

The chapter covers how to use the Rcpp package. Rcpp (R with C Plus Plus - you can't have + symbols in a package name) is a package that makes rewriting R in C++ much easier, just like devtools makes creating packages easier.

If you look at R packages on Github, you can find that they include code from languages that aren't R. For example, 34% of the [github repo](https://github.com/r-lib/rlang) for the rlang package is written in C.

# Specific notes

You can use C++ to run loops which will be quicker than if you ran them in R.

When rewriting R code in C++, you have to remember key differences between the two languages. One crucial difference is that in R vector indices start at 1, whereas in C++ they start at 0.
