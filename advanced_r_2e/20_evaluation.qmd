"Together, quasiquotation, quosures, and data masks form what we call tidy evaluation, or tidy eval for short. Tidy eval provides a principled approach to non-standard evaluation that makes it possible to use such functions both interactively and embedded with other functions."

Data mask: an expression where a data frame and an environment are combined.

This chapter is fairly detailed and above my current skill-level.
