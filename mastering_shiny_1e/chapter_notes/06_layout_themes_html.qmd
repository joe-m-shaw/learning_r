"Layout functions provide the high-level visual structure of an app. Layouts are created by a hierarchy of function calls, where the hierarchy in R matches the hierarchy in the generated HTML."

"Each row is made up of 12 columns and the first argument to column() gives how many of those columns to occupy."

"The simple way to break up a page into pieces is to use tabsetPanel() and its close friend tabPanel()."

"Bootstrap is a collection of HTML conventions, CSS styles, and JS snippets bundled up into a convenient form."

"The most important thing to know is that thereâ€™s no magic behind all the input, output, and layout functions: they just generate HTML. You can see that HTML by executing UI functions directly in the console"
