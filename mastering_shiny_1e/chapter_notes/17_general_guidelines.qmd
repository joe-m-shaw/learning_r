## Dependencies

"Another tool for managing dependencies is the config package. The config package doesn’t actually manage dependencies itself, but it does provide a convenient place for you to track and manage dependencies other than R packages. For instance, you might specify the *path to a CSV file that your application depends on*".

## Code review

"Typically, a code review involves someone other than you, but you can still benefit even if it’s only you. Most experienced developers will agree that taking a moment to review your own code often reveals some small flaw, particularly if you can let it sit for at least a few hours between writing and review."
