Users can upload and download data from Shiny apps.

"I recommend using .tsv (tab separated value) instead of .csv (comma separated values) because many European countries use commas to separate the whole and fractional parts of a number (e.g. 1,23 vs 1.23)."

Downloading reports can be done using paramaterised RMarkdown documents (similar to how I created automated reports for *RFC1* testing).
