"Itâ€™s important to understand the basic data flow in interactive plots in order to understand their limitations. The basic flow is something like this:

1. JavaScript captures the mouse event.

2. Shiny sends the mouse event data back to R, telling the app that the input is now out of date.

3. All the downstream reactive consumers are recomputed.

4. plotOutput() generates a new PNG and sends it to the browser."

This chapter talks about the different ways in which you can make Shiny plots interactive, focussing on mouse clicks and "brushes" (drawing rectangles around data).
