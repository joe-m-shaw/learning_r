# Inputs

"All input functions have the same first argument: inputId. This is the identifier used to connect the front end with the back end: if your UI has an input with ID "name", the server function will access it with input$name."

Input ID:

- ID: must be unique and without special characters, like an R variable

- Label: a human readable label

- Value: the default value

"Note that the {} are only required in render functions if need to run multiple lines of code."
