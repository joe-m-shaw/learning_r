"Using the tools described in part two of this book, we can actually set up the project, right from the very beginning, in a way that it will be reproducible quite naturally. "

Docker solves the issue of installing older packages.

# 9: Rewriting our project

Turn scripts into markdown documents.

Literate programming has the advantage over code comments in that it can include much more context and detail.

The general format is:
- Explain what you're doing
- Write a function
- Use that function

knitr::knit_child creates a child document.

This is really helpful if you want to have lots of code chunks which are formatted in the same way (a plot for dataset1, the same plot for dataset 2 etc).

# 10: Freezing packages

"At a minimum, {renv} ensures that a project’s library doesn’t interfere with another project’s library while you’re working on different projects."

renv alone is not enough to ensure reproducibility - it gives a list of which versions of packages you used, but in practice it can be really hard to install old package versions and recreate the exact environment.

# 11: Packaging your code

The term fusen comes from origami - flat paper is inflated to create a box shape.
