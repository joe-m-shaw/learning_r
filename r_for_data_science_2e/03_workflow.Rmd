## Shortcuts

https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE

Insert pipe operator 	          Ctrl+Shift+M
Insert assignment operator 	    Alt+-  (this only works in R code chunks if you are in a markdown file)

Alt + shift + K brings up all the keyboard shortcuts.

Alt + tab allows you to move between windows easily on Windows machines.

Windows key + up or down arrows allows you to minimise or maximise windows.

## Pipe Operator

The new pipe |> has been used in base R since v4.1.0
