```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

```

The tidyverse library for dealing with factors is forcats.

forcats is an anagram of factors.

Use forcats::fct() in tidyverse instead of factor() in base R because it will flag if something is not in the factor levels.

There are several useful functions within forcats that it's useful to be aware of: fct_reorder, fct_infreq, fct_recode and fct_collapse.
