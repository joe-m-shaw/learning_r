"Unlike the Apple, Windows, or Android operating systems on your personal devices, most servers run the Linux operating system."

"The cloud is rental servers"

Server renting was started by Amazon in 2006.
Cloud servers are an alternative to servers "on prem" ("on the premises").

"When you rent a server from a cloud provider, you are usually not renting a whole server. Instead, youâ€™re renting a virtualized server or a virtual machine (vm), usually called an instance. What you see as your server is probably just a part of a larger physical server you share with other cloud provider customers."
