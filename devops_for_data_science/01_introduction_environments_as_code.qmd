# Introduction

"DevOps is a squishy concept, much like the closely related Agile software development process."

"It took a little while for the field to be formalized, with the term DevOps coming into common usage around 2010."

"While most data scientists have ways to share code, sharing environments isn’t always standard practice, but it should be."

# Environments as Code

3 layers of an environment:

1. Hardware: the actual machine the code is running on

2. System: the operating system and essential libraries (like R)
 
3. Package: the R packages your code needs

"In Python, there are many different options for virtual environment tooling. I recommend {virtualenv}/{venv} and related tools for production data science.

In R, there’s really only one game in town: the {renv} package."
