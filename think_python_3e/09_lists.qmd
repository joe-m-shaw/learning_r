```{python}
#| label: python-list
#| include: TRUE

# Python
numbers = [42, 123]

```

```{r}
#| label: r-list
#| include: TRUE

# R
numbers <- list(42, 123)

```

"Unlike strings, lists are mutable."

```{python}
#| label: python-mutable-list
#| include: TRUE

# In Python, this modifies the second element
numbers[1] = 17

numbers



```

```{r}
#| label: r-mutable-list
#| include: TRUE

# In R, the first element gets modified
numbers[1] <- 17

numbers
