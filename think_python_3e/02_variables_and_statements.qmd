## Assigment

```{python} 

n = 17


```

```{r}

n <- 17


```

"a state diagram because it shows what state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind)."

Same syntax rules apply for naming in Python as in R.

Module


# Arguments

"When you call a function, the expression in parenthesis is called an argument. Normally I would explain why, but in this case the technical meaning of a term has almost nothing to do with the common meaning of the word, so I won’t even try."

# Comments

Mark comments with a hash (#) just as you would do in R.

```{python}

# Comments can go here
42 * 3 # Comments can also go here

```

```{r}

42 * 3 # Comments can also go here

```
