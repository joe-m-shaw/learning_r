"One challenge of working with paths is that they look different on different operating systems. On macOS and UNIX systems like Linux, the directory and file names in a path are separated by a forward slash, /. Windows uses a backward slash. So, if you you run these examples on Windows, you will see backward slashes in the paths, and youâ€™ll have to replace the forward slashes in the examples."
