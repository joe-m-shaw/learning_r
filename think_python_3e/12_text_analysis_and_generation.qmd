This chapter focuses on text generation, which is interesting to know about but
not that relevant to my work at the moment. I skim-read it and made brief notes.

"Characters in Python strings are in Unicode, which is an international standard used to represent letters in nearly every alphabet, numbers, symbols, punctuation marks, and more."

"Given the same inputs, most computer programs are deterministic, which means they generate the same outputs every time. Determinism is usually a good thing, since we expect the same calculation to yield the same result."

"Instead of looking at one word at a time, now weâ€™ll look at sequences of two words, which are called bigrams. A sequence of three words is called a trigram, and a sequence with some unspecified number of words is called an n-gram."
