# Increments

"Increasing the value of a variable is called an increment; decreasing the value is called a decrement. Because these operations are so common, Python provides augmented assignment operators that update a variable more concisely."

```{python}
#| label: python-increments
#| include: TRUE

z = 1

# += operator means "add and assign to the same variable"
z += 2

z

z *= 2

z

z -= 3

z

```

# Methods

In Python, a method is a function associated with an object.

```{r}
#| label: python-method
#| include: TRUE

# object
name = "JOSEPH"

# object.method
name.lower()

```

The same execution in R uses the function name before adding the object name as an argument to the function:

```{r}
#| label: r-method
#| include: TRUE

name <- "JOSEPH"

tolower(name)

```

# Docstrings

You can write tests in the docstrings of Python functions and then run the tests.
