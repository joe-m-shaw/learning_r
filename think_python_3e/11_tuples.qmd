"One note: There are two ways to pronounce “tuple”. Some people say “tuh-ple”, which rhymes with “supple”. But in the context of programming, most people say “too-ple”, which rhymes with “quadruple”."

"A tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and they are indexed by integers, so tuples are a lot like lists. The important difference is that tuples are immutable."

"Because tuples are immutable, they are hashable, which means they can be used as keys in a dictionary."

```{python}
#| include: TRUE

# List - square brackets, mutable
python_list = [0, 1, 2]

# Dictionary - curly brackets
python_dict = {'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2}

# Tuple - round brackets
python_tuple = (0, 1, 2)

```
