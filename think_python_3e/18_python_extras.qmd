This chapter covers several extra features of Python. Most were above my 
current level but the part on conditional expressions was useful.
Other classes: sets and counters

# Conditional expressions

```{python}
#| include: TRUE

x  = 1

# Verbose form
if x > 0:
    y = math.log(x)
else:
    y = float('nan')

# Concise form
y = math.log(x) if x > 0 else float('nan')

y

# Verbose form with a conditional statement
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Concise form with a conditional expression
def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n-1)

factorial(5)

```
