"Programs must be written for people to read and only 
incidentally for machines to execute." - Hal Abelson

This is often changed to: "write code for humans, not computers".

There are 4 kinds of documentation:

- Tutorials: learning oriented
- How-to guides: problem oriented
- Explanations: understanding oriented
- Reference guides: information oriented

Documentation can be split into whether it is intended to be useful
for developers or for end users.
