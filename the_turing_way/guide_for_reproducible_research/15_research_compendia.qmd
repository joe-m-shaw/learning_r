"A research compendium [def] combines all elements of your project, 
allowing others to reproduce your work, and should be the final product 
of your research project."

The three main types of objects in a research compendia are:

- Read only: raw data (the inputs to the compendia)

- Human-generated: code (i.e scripts), manuscripts (MarkDown documents, 
Quarto etc), documentation (README, other documentation).

- Project-generated: cleaned data (i.e. data cleaned by a human-generated
script), figures and other output
