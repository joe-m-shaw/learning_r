BinderHub: an open source tool for bringing together (i.e "binding") different
computer environments.

https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/team.html
"The Binder Project is a sub-project of Project Jupyter, which is a 
fiscally-sponsored project of NumFocus, a 501c3 non-profit."

"Binder is an open source web service that lets users create sharable, 
interactive, reproducible environments in the cloud. "

Binder seems like a useful tool for large collaborative projects, but probably
not relevant to my work at the moment.
