# Open Research

Open research: the outputs of publicly funded research should be 
publicly accessible.

"Citizen science: The inclusion of members of the public 
in scientific research."

# Open Data

"The first preprint server called arXiv was established in 1991 for 
physical sciences. Likely due to the inefficiency of traditional 
journals, preprint servers for other disciplines have grown hugely 
in popularity over the last 5 years, with the emergence of bioRxiv, 
medRxiv, ChemRxiv, SocArXiv and many more. "

# Open Notebooks

"Open notebook [def] research is simply the practice of making 
such notebooks openly available, usually online."
