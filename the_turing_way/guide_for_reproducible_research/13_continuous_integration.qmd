Continuous integration means regular merging or regular combining of work.

CI works best when it is automated - rather than having individual people remember to run tests every time they make a commit, you can set up GitHub to automatically do this.

CI encourages people to make small changes and merge branches quickly - this ensures everyone is working on the same thing, without different branches diverging too far to be merged.
