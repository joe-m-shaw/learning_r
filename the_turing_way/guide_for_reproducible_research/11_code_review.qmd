This chapter covers how to do code reviews, which is less relevant to me
as there is no-one in my team who codes in R, but still good to know about.

"Don’t review for more than an hour at a time, after that the success 
rate drops quite quickly."

"Don’t review more than 400 lines of code (LOC) at a time, less than 
200 LOC is better. Don’t review more than 500 LOC/hour."
