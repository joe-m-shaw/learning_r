Static code analysis: "Static code analysis is a method that examines 
code and detects software vulnerabilities before your code is executed
or the project is built and deployed."

A 3 stage process to writing higher quality code:

1. Describe the assumptions your code makes (i.e. it assumes the input
is type double)

2. Assert your assumptions 

3. Deal with unmet assumptions. What should happen when your assertion is
not true? Should there be a warning or should the code stop running?
