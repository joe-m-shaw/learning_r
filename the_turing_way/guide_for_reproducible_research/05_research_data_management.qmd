"A Data Management Plan (DMP), or Output Management Plan, is a 
document that describes how your research outputs will be generated,
stored, used and shared within your project."

The FAIR framework:
- Findability
- Accessibility
- Interoperability
- Reusability

"The capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, 
and reuse data, with none or minimal human intervention, is essential 
in todayâ€™s data-driven era"

"FAIR practices can result in highly efficient code implementations, 
reduce the need to retrain models, and reduce unnecessary data 
generation/storage, thus reducing the overall carbon footprint."

"As a test for your spreadsheet compatibility with reproducible research, 
export your data from the spreadsheet to the CSV format and reopen it. 
If you can still get all the information that you stored in your sheet,
then your data is fine."

"you should also be aware of the default behaviour of your spreadsheet 
program, as it may be different for different programs, and different 
versions of the same program. For instance, the decimal is usually 
indicated with a comma in the French or German versions of Excel."

## Electronic lab notebooks

"Proprietary solutions are incentivised to attempt to lock-in their customers 
so that the cost of switching to a competitor is high - so be especially wary 
of poor export options."

"Note that this tends to change over time. New providers are focused on user
acquisition so data portability is often good at first but tends to decline 
after a certain point in time. Firms tends to follow a pattern of shifting 
from a user acquisition phase with favourable terms, to a user retention phase
with less favourable ones. Mendeley for example began encrypting their local
database. This made it impossible to migrate your local library to different
reference managers without going through the Mendeley online library feature.
This occurred after they had reached a high degree of market penetration and
had been acquired by Elsevier."

## Data Repositories

"Long-term archiving repositories are designed for secure and permanent 
storage of data, ensuring data preservation over extended periods. This 
differs from platforms like GitHub and GitLab which primarily serve as
collaborative development tools, facilitating version control and project 
management in a more dynamic and transient environment. Platforms such as 
GitHub and GitLab do not assign persistent identifiers to repositories, and 
their preservation policies are more flexible compared to those of data
repositories."

"Supplemental materials are not following the FAIR principles - as 
there is no separate DOI assigned to the supplemental materials which
makes it difficult to retrieve these materials. "
