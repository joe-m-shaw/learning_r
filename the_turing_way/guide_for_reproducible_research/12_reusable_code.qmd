Reusing code can take different forms

Repeatable: can you rerun the same code with the same data?

Rerunnable: can you rerun the same code with different data?

A general checklist of areas to think about:

- Version control
- Code stored publicly (i.e. on the internet)
- Documentation
- Description of the computing environment required
- Location of the data
- No reliance on steps performed by humans
- License
- Readable code: consistent nomenclature, consistent style
