This chapter gives the same advice as Jenny Bryan: file names should be
readable by machines and humans, and sort well.

"Computers like names to have no spaces, deliberate use of delimiters, 
and no special or accented characters."

The bottom line is pick a convention, stick to it and make sure any 
collaborator's are aware of the convention.
