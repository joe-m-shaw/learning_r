Trusted Research Environment: "Typically TREs offer researchers collaborating on a project involving sensitive data a computing environment with restrictions on the ingress and egress of code, data and other research outputs appropriate to the level of sensitivity of the data in question."

"TREs set up for researchers to work on particularly sensitive data will likely lack internet access, in order to prevent a data breach or the accidental disclosure of sensitive data outside the TRE."
