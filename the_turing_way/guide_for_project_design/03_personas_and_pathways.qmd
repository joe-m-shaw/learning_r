"A persona is a detail of an imaginary user or member, based on real-world
observations and understandings of existing members or potential future members.
It is meaningful when paired with pathways through which these personas 
engage with a project."

Personas are a way to anticipate how people could contribute to a big open
source project. It's useful to know about, but less relevant to the sort of 
projects I work on.
