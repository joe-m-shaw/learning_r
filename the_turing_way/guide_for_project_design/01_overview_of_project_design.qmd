"Before starting a project, researchers must define the projectâ€™s scope."

"Everyone applies various design concepts to their project formally or
informally. However, often we think about these concepts retrospectively, 
when the project is over and we gain a better understanding of design 
mistakes that could have been avoided with better planning and organisation."
