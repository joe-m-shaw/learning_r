# README

"Given that itâ€™s best to include a couple of examples in README.md, ideally you would generate it with R Markdown. That is, it works well to have README.Rmd as the main source file, which you then render to README.md."

# NEWS

"The README is aimed at new users, whereas the NEWS file is aimed at existing users: it should list all the changes in each release that a user might notice or want to learn more about."
