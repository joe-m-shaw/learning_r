Other folders that can be included in packages:

**src**: src stands for "source". This is to do with connecting R to C++, which is beyond my current skillset.

**inst**: inst stands for "installed files". This folder is for "arbitrary additional files that you want to include in your package."

**tools**: additional files needed during configuration.
