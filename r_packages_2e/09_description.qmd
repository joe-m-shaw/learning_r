DESCRIPTION file: "provides overall metadata about the package, such as the package name and which other packages it depends on"

NAMESPACE file: "specifies which functions your package makes available for others to use and, optionally, imports functions from other packages."

This chapter focusses on the different components of each metadata file, which will be more relevant if I want to submit a package to CRAN.
